## Add the Plugin name here!(example: plugin-doc-template)

Write about the Plugin content clearly and directly, what the Plugin does, and, if necessary, what the Plugin does not do.

Do this to avoid ambiguous interpretations and not to make the documentation hard to use.

Example:

This plugin has in its sections instructions on how to fill in and what information to use in your plugin documentation.

> This Plugin does not add or generate automatic documentation for your Plugin, filling in the information is the sole responsibility of the Plugin creator or Studio manager.
